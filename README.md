# Ticket-Tracker
A ticket tracker to facilitate finding repeating problems and how to fix them


Ideas:
- keyword based search / custom search
- comments on tickets
- possibility to add screenshots attachments
- flag ticket as ongoing / solved / abandonned
- detailed description of problem with title, description, environment and tools related to problem, solution, keywords ...
- user management with profile view / change history etc
- track search requests or maybe add a search session functionality to track results used and timestamp each time the same problem occurs in the logs
